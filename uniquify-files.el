;;; Commentary

;; A file completion style in which the completion string displayed to
;; the user consists of the file basename followed by enough of the
;; directory part to make the string identify a unique file.
;;
;; We accomplish this by preprocessing the list of absolute file names
;; to be in that style, in an alist with the original absolute file
;; names, and do completion on that alist.
